## Що таке Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFT) - Проста домовленність про мабутні токени? 

Проста домовленність про майбутні токени (SAFT) - це інвестиційний контракт, що пропонується розробниками криптовалюти до [акредитованих інвесторів](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accreditedinvestor.asp). 
Через те, що SAFT-и вважаються цінними паперами, ці токени повинні відповідати нормам цінних паперів.

Raising funds through the sale of digital currency requires more than just building a [blockchain](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp). Investors want to know what they are getting into, whether or not the currency will be viable, and if they will be legally protected.

While a company that decides to raise money through [cryptocurrency](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cryptocurrency.asp) could bypass using a formal framework to tap into global financial markets, it needs to adhere to international, federal, and state law. One way to do this is by using a SAFT.

### KEY TAKEAWAYS

-   A simple agreement for future tokens (SAFT) is a security issued for the eventual transfer of digital tokens from cryptocurrency developers to investors.
-   SAFTs were created to help cryptocurrency ventures fundraise without violating regulations.
-   A SAFT can be compared to a simple agreement for future equity (SAFE), which allows startup investors to convert their cash investment into equity at a point in the future.

## Understanding Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFTs) 

A SAFT is a form of an investment contract. They were created as a way to help new cryptocurrency ventures raise money without breaking financial regulations, specifically, regulations that govern when an investment is considered a [security](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/security.asp).

The speed at which cryptocurrencies have grown has far outpaced the speed at which regulators have addressed legal issues. It wasn’t until 2017 that the [Securities and Exchange Commission](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp)(SEC) provided substantial guidance on when the sale of an [initial coin offering](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/initial-coin-offering-ico.asp) (ICO) or other tokens would be considered the same as the sale of a security.

One of the most important regulatory hurdles that a new crypto venture must pass is the [Howey Test](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/howey-test.asp). The U.S. Supreme Court created this in 1946 in its ruling on _Securities and Exchange Commission v. W. J. Howey Co.,_ which determines whether a transaction is considered a security.

### SAFT Regulations 

Because cryptocurrency developers are unlikely to be well-versed in securities law and may not have access to financial and legal counsel, it can be easy for them to run afoul of regulations. The development of SAFT creates a simple, inexpensive framework that new ventures can use to raise funds while remaining legally compliant.

When a company sells an investor a SAFT, it is accepting funds from that investor but does not sell, offer, or exchange a coin or token. Instead, the investor receives documentation indicating that the investor will be given access if a cryptocurrency or other product is created.

## Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFT) vs. Simple Agreement for Future Equity (SAFE) 

A SAFT is different from a Simple Agreement for Future Equity (SAFE), which allows investors who put cash into a startup to convert that stake into equity at a later date. Developers use funds from the sale of SAFT to develop the network and technology required to create a functional token and then provide these tokens to investors with the expectation that there will be a market to sell these tokens to.

Because a SAFT is a non-debt financial instrument, investors who purchase a SAFT face the possibility that they will lose their money and have no recourse if the venture fails. The document only allows investors to take a financial stake in the venture, meaning that investors are exposed to the same enterprise risk as if they had purchased a SAFE.
