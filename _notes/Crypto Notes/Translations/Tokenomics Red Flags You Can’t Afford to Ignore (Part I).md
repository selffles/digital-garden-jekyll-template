Tokenomics study is one of the main pillars of fundamental analysis. In simple words, tokenomics means the economy of the tokens (coins). Tokenomics study helps you to understand better the monetary policy behind the projects.

There are many online resources out there trying to define tokenomics. However, few of them are talking about the red flags you have to consider once you start to perform such an analysis. For that reason, I tried to detect 9 important red flags related to the Tokenomics studies.

1.  Unlimited Supply
2.  Unfair Vesting Schedule
3.  Unfair Distribution
4.  Inflationary Tokens
5.  Possibility of Unwanted Changes in the Future
6.  Non-Transparent Tokenomics
7.  Centralized Mechanisms
8.  Non-optimal Token Issuance
9.  Lack of Use Cases

In the first part of this series, I am going to explain the first 4 items of this list.

# Unlimited Supply

We love “unlimited” things!

Do you hate driving on an unlimited-speed highway?

Don’t you wish to go to a buffet restaurant, even if you have a full stomach?

What about someone loving you unconditionally and with no limits?

See? Human beings naturally are searching for unlimited sources of everything!

Things are getting more interesting when we talk about money.

> More money = More freedom

Well … as far as this is a bold statement, there are some levels of truth behind it! At the end of the day, money rules the world these days.

Now let's talk about a misconception related to this in tokenomics studies.

Many newbie investors think “unlimited supply” for a token means more freedom.

WRONG!

Unlimited supply is a poison capable of killing projects and their investors. Here is why:

Unlimited supply means that **at no time** there will be a possibility of shortage for that token.

Why?

Because there is always the possibility to mint new tokens.

As a result, the supply and demand equation will be disturbed.

For example, it is very likely that at times, the supply is so high and the demand is too low. As a result, the asset’s price will be dropped significantly.

The abundance of the tokens also can cause inflation … or better to say hyper-inflation. This is the same effect as having more money in society.

> More money in the hands = more buy/sell pressure = more inflation

One thing I would like to mention here is that “Unlimited Supply” is not always necessarily a bad thing, though!

Confused?

Let me explain.

Right now, Ether (ETH) and Dogecoin (DOGE) tokens both have unlimited supplies.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*COpuUk4G__CFktL5vOiEgg.png)

Ether is the fuel of the Ethereum ecosystem and it has lots of use-cases in dApps, smart contracts, and so on. On the other hand, DOGE is a meme token, mostly promoted by Mr. Elon Musk. Therefore, it makes sense to imagine that ETH’s demand is (or will be) so high that limited supply cannot meet the market needs for it. The same statement is not true for DOGE. You also need to take into consideration that ETH has burning mechanisms such as [EIP-1559](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/eip-1559-faq). This indeed will make ETH a deflationary asset over time — even if its max supply remains unlimited.

> 🚩 a token with unlimited supply and no understable reason behind it.

# Unfair Vesting Schedule

Vesting is a fancy word in the crypto realm. According to the CoinMarketCap:

> Vesting period, also called token lockup period, refers to **a period of time in which the tokens sold in the pre-sale of ICO stage are prevented from being sold for a specific period of time**.

I know! You may now think that we are not living in the ICO (Initial Coin Offering) era anymore. For those of you who are missing the context here, I suggest you read some history on ICOs.

[

## ICO 101 — History of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs)

### PART 1- From MasterCoin to Ethereum

In summary, there was a time when projects asked investors for some money before launching their projects or getting listed on any exchanges. In return, these early investors could expect to gain crazy returns (or not!), once the projects were launched. In most of these ICOs, investors needed to lock up their initial investment for a specific period of time (e.g. 1 year). This means that they were not able to touch their money before the end of that period. That interval is called “Vesting Period” or “Locked-Up Period”.

Enough with the history and let's return back to the reality we are living in today!

These days, many projects still have vesting (locking) schedules with their tokens. The main reason behind this decision is to prevent the early investors from selling off their assets in the early stages of the project’s development/release.

This indeed is a healthy and good practice. It protects the investors from the price fluctuation usually seen in the early days. At the same time, the possibility of “pumps and dumps” triggered by whales and keyholders of tokens will be minimized.

Uniswap (UNI) token vesting schedule

However, in reality, many of these vesting mechanisms suffer from serious problems.

A common problem is related to non-optimal vesting schedules. For example, you can find a token with this schedule:

1st year: all tokens are locked.

2nd year: 70% of locked tokens will be unlocked.

3rd year: 30% of locked tokens will be unlocked.

This is a recipe for disaster! It simply means that starting from the second year, you should expect to see a dramatic sell pressure initiated by the people who have locked tokens. This is an aggressive mechanism for unlocking.

Interestingly enough, on the other side of the spectrum, there are some tokens with super relaxed vesting schedules. Here we are talking about tokens releasing somewhere around 0.5-1% of their locked tokens to the market annually. Suppose that these tokens are utility tokens needed by the ecosystem. With these relaxed releases, users of the ecosystem will simply find it complicated to locate enough tokens in the market. This of course may lead to scarcity and eventually price jumps. However, in the long run and in many cases, the real users of the ecosystem may move to other projects in which the price fluctuation and accessibility of tokens are fairer.

Finally, in some cases, the problem is related to non-transparency in the schedules. Some projects mention in their whitepapers that they have X% of the tokens locked for developers of the project, key investors, etc. However, they are not communicating anything about the plans for unlocking those tokens. This simply means that **at any point in time**, you may expect to see sell pressure.

> 🚩 a token with aggressive or relaxed vesting schedule, non-transparent communication about the vesting schedule

# Unfair Distribution

When we talk about fair monetary policy, the first thing that comes to mind is the fair distribution of wealth among the population. This is exactly what makes the traditional finance model a shitty one! Under such models, the rich people get richer, while the poor people do not have equal access to the banking system and wealth and they are getting poorer every single day!

> **The greatest country, the richest country, is not that which has the most capitalists, monopolists, immense grabbings, vast fortunes, with its sad, sad soil of extreme, degrading, damning poverty, but the land in which there are the most homesteads, freeholds — where wealth does not show such contrasts high and low, where all men have enough — a modest living — and no man is made possessor beyond the sane and beautiful necessities.**
> 
> **— WALT WHITMAN  
> AMERICAN POET (1819–1892)**

There are many technical, political, and financial reasons behind the unfair distribution of wealth among people. However, the one single reason that we are interested in here is the **centralized and non-optimal distribution model dictated by the wealth owners**!

In the case of traditional finance, this translates to the policies made by governments, central banks, or financial institutes. They are in charge of printing money. Later on, they are in charge of distributing this printed money (and credit) among people. In many cases, these centralized entities prioritize their own needs. This simply means that they print money for themselves to pay pending debts, etc.

Now let's talk about the crypto assets and blockchain projects.

![Token Distribution of Uniswap, Avalanche, Solana, and Elrond](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*qdHOgcEeuM-_MtBK.png)

Token Distribution of Uniswap, Avalanche, Solana, and Elrond

Here we do not have any banks or governments. Yet, the companies or developers behind the projects may force unfair monetary policy on token holders.

How?

By simply distributing more tokens to a special group of people.

-   ICO investors
-   Principal Investors
-   Presale Investors
-   Seed Sale
-   Partners/Sponsors of the Project
-   Developers
-   Advisors
-   The company behind the Project

In principle, whatever percentage that is **not assigned** to public sale can be considered as a bias in the monetary policy. However, there are some exceptions to this rule. For example, some projects dedicate a percentage of their max supply for paying staking rewards to the network users. This is an inevitable measure. Another famous example is treasury funds. These funds are usually used for the future development of the project or are considered as some backup mechanism for facing possible crises in the future.

You should also pay special attention to the projects having the majority of their tokens in the hands of a few whales. This could be a direct result of the initial unfair distribution. If 80% of imaginary token X belongs to 10 keyholders, then at any single moment, you should expect to see a pump and dump or rug pull.

> 🚩 a token with unfair distribution or a great sum of tokens in hand of few whales.

# Inflationary Tokens

Inflationary tokens are the ones with the net increase in circulation. Deflationary tokens are the ones with the net decrease in circulation.

There are two words you hear again and again in the crypto space, and in general, if you deal with any financial market:

-   **Supply:** the amount of the asset (e.g cryptocurrency, gold, money) available to trade.
-   **Demand:** the amount of requests from the investors to purchase the asset.

Now, according to the Supply and Demand law, the price of any asset is mainly dictated by its supply and demand.

Let me give you an example related to the Covid19.

Back in 2020, many people started to use wearable masks. Countries also passed laws to make mask-wearing compulsory. At that time, the demand for masks raised like crazy. On the other hand, there was not enough supply in the market. As a result, the price of masks increased. I personally remember buying 1 mask from a pharmacy for 3$.

As time passed, people got vaccinated. Some countries raised the laws for wearing masks. Moreover, the mask companies elevated their production lines activities. As a result, there were more than enough masks in the market (and still are). This time, the demand decreased significantly. Therefore, the price of masks decreased significantly. Now, I can buy one for 7 cents from a pharmacy.

This was a simple example to show you that the prices of assets are heavily affected by the supply and demand sides of the market.

Now, how all of these is related to Inflationary Tokens?

More supply (token issuance) leads to a net increase in circulation (inflation). As a result, the token price may be affected in the reverse direction (downwards).

To have deflationary tokens, we basically have two options:

1.  **Limit the max supply:** as we discussed earlier if the maximum supply of an asset is limited, it finally reaches a point in which no new tokens will be minted. Therefore, there will be a net decrease in the market on the supply side.
2.  **Token Burning:** tokens with unlimited max supply usually use some mechanisms to burn some of the existing tokens in circulation. Token burning will help the project to moderate the net circulation of the asset in the market. If implemented correctly, this may even lead to a net decrease (deflationary tokens).

A famous example for this section is the Ether token.

As you know, ETH has an unlimited supply. Moreover, there was no burning mechanism implemented for this token. This means that ETH was an inflationary token.

This all changed after [EIP-1559](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1559.md). This was a feature implemented in 2021 in the Ethereum blockchain to burn some tokens in each transaction.

![Daily Amount of Ether burnt due to EIP-155⁹¹](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*T_GOnkkwJbEdG6_391on3A.png)

Daily Amount of Ether burnt due to EIP-1559[¹](https://etherscan.io/chart/dailyethburnt)

Thanks to this implementation, millions of Ether tokens got out of circulation. At times, ETH also gets deflationary. In other words, there are some blocks in which the burnt tokens are more than the mined ones.

When studying a project, you have to pay special attention to the inflation/deflation rates of the tokens. Check the max supply and burning mechanisms of the token.

> 🚩 a token with net increase in circulation and no burning mechanisms or similar approaches to face the situation.
